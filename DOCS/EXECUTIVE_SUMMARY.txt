# ⚡ Executive Summary - 2 Minute Read

## Your Problem
**Orders placed but not appearing in orderbook**

## Root Cause
**RMS (Risk Management System) Emergency Exit** triggered because:
- Your current loss: **-₹499**
- System maximum loss: **-₹15**
- Result: **NEW ORDERS BLOCKED** to protect your account

## What Was Built For You

### 📊 Visual Tracking (2 ways)
1. **Enhanced Orderbook** - See status cards (Total, Pending, Executed, Failed)
2. **Diagnostics Page** - See complete 6-stage pipeline

### 🛠️ Tools (3 ways to verify)
1. **Verify Script** - `python verify_orders.py`
2. **API Endpoints** - `/dashboard/diagnostics/orders`
3. **Intent Logs** - Watch `logs/intent_tracking.log`

### 📚 Documentation (5 guides)
- Quick Reference (1 page cheat sheet)
- Quick Start (10-minute tutorial)
- Complete Guide (30-minute reference)
- API Reference (JSON documentation)
- Implementation Details (for developers)

## How It Works (The 6 Stages)

```
1. Order Created       → In dashboard
2. Database Write      → Saved to orders.db (status: CREATED)
3. Risk Check  ❌      ← YOUR ORDERS STOPPED HERE (RMS blocks)
4. Broker Send         → Would send to broker (SENT_TO_BROKER)
5. Watcher Poll        → Would get fill status (EXECUTED)
6. Orderbook Display   → Would show in web UI
```

**Your orders are stuck at Stage 3 due to excessive losses.**

## What You Can Do NOW

### 1. Verify Orders Are in Database (30 seconds)
```bash
python verify_orders.py
```
✅ Confirms orders ARE being saved (not a bug)

### 2. See Visual Dashboard (1 minute)
Open: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard/web/order_diagnostics.html`

✅ See order status breakdown and pipeline visualization

### 3. Fix RMS Issue (Next hour)
Close losing positions to reduce PnL loss from -₹499 to at least -₹15

✅ Once fixed, RMS will allow new orders

### 4. Try Again
Place new order and watch it progress through 6 stages

✅ Should reach orderbook in 5-10 seconds
